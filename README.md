# chipul8
A CHIP8 VM in multiple languages, primarily C++.

Created to shake off rust in my programming skills, the CHIPUL8 project
is something I'm fairly proud of, even if a CHIP8 interpreter is a relatively
simple project. I am hoping to make C++ versions with SDL, OGL, and any other
libraries I may wish to learn. I am also hoping to port it to various architectures
and maybe even an ASM version, if I feel brave/smart/sadistic enough.
